# LLM Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning while following Ed Donner’s LLM course.

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey as I go through the course, experiment with different tools and models, and gradually build a stronger understanding of how LLMs work in practice.

I will keep writing and updating this README until I complete the course.

## 📅 Progress Log
