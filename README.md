# LLM Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning while following Ed Donner’s LLM course.

The goal is to:
- Understand LLMs from fundamentals to applications
- Experiment locally using Ollama
- Track progress week by week with clean commits and notes

## 📅 Progress Log

### Day 1 – Ollama Setup & Local Model Experiments
- Installed and set up Ollama
- Ran multiple local LLMs and tested basic prompts
- Explored early limitations of small models such as gemma3:270m and phi3 etc
